# Penguin Data Visualization (R Project)

This project showscases data wrangling and visualization skills in R using the `palmerpenguins` dataset. 

## What the Code Does

- Cleans missing data
- Groups and summarizes penguin data by species and sex
- Creates visualizations:
  - Bar chart by species and sex
  - Boxplot of body mass
  - Scatterplot showing relationship between body mass and flipper length
  - Faceted plots by sex

## Notable Trend

When filtering for penguins labeled as "Heavy" (above-median body mass within their species and sex), I found that the male Chinstrap penguins had the longest average bill length. Across species, heavier males tended to have longer bills than their lighter or female counterparts.

## Tools & Packages
- dplyr
- ggplot2
- tidyr
- stringr

## Visual Examples
See the `plots/` folder for charts.
